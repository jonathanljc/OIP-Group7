# 🌿 Kibble Palace Footfall Tracking Project Showcase Website  

## 🔍 About This Website

This static website serves as the final showcase for our design project under the Singapore–Glasgow Overseas Immersion Programme. The project explores a discreet, low-cost, and non-intrusive solution to help the Kibble Palace (a heritage-listed 19th-century glasshouse in Glasgow Botanic Gardens) accurately measure visitor footfall for budgeting and planning purposes.

Hosted via GitHub Pages, this site documents our **full design journey**, including our user-centric approach, prototypes, stakeholder engagement, and key deliverables.
