                            <li><strong>Visitor Demographics:</strong> Discovered the diverse age range and technology comfort levels of typical visitors</li>
                            <li><strong>Operational Needs:</strong> Understood staff workflows and the importance of real-time data for crowd management</li>
                            <li><strong>Budget Realities:</strong> Gained appreciation for the financial constraints facing public institutions</li>

                        <div class="pride-text">
                            <p><strong>Inclusive Design Approach:</strong> We're particularly proud of how we prioritized accessibility from the beginning. Rather than creating a solution that only works for tech-savvy users, we designed a system that truly serves all visitor demographics. The dual QR/Kiosk approach ensures no one is excluded from participating.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Stakeholder-Centered Process:</strong> Our commitment to continuous stakeholder engagement resulted in a solution that addresses real operational needs rather than theoretical problems. We listened, adapted, and iterated based on genuine feedback.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Heritage Sensitivity:</strong> We successfully balanced modern technology needs with respect for the historical significance of Kibble Palace. Our non-invasive approach preserves the building's integrity while providing valuable functionality.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Team Collaboration:</strong> Despite diverse backgrounds and expertise areas, our team maintained excellent communication and shared ownership of the project outcomes. Each member contributed meaningfully to the final solution.</p>

                            <p><strong>Technical Implementation Depth:</strong> While our prototypes effectively demonstrate the concept, we acknowledge that a production-ready system would require more robust backend infrastructure and security measures than we were able to fully develop within our timeframe.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>User Testing Scale:</strong> Although we conducted user interviews and gathered feedback, we would have benefited from more extensive testing with actual Kibble Palace visitors to validate our assumptions about user behavior and preferences.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Data Analytics Sophistication:</strong> Our dashboard provides basic metrics, but we recognize that more advanced analytics capabilities (predictive modeling, trend analysis) would provide greater value to stakeholders.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Implementation Planning:</strong> While we focused heavily on design and user experience, we could have developed more detailed implementation timelines and change management strategies for actual deployment.</p>

                            <p>This project taught us that successful design isn't just about creating elegant solutionsâ€”it's about understanding constraints, respecting context, and prioritizing user needs over technological sophistication. The most innovative solution isn't always the most complex one.</p>
                            
                            <p>We learned the value of iterative design and the importance of remaining flexible as new information emerges. Our willingness to pivot from a mobile-only solution to a hybrid approach ultimately resulted in a much stronger final product.</p>
