                <h2>Partner Interactions - Full Reflection</h2>
                <span class="close" onclick="closePartnerModal()">&times;</span>
            </div>
            <div class="modal-body">
                <p class="modal-lead">Our partnership with Friends of Glasgow proved to be one of the most valuable and transformative aspects of this project. What began as a standard stakeholder relationship evolved into a genuine collaboration that fundamentally shaped our understanding of heritage site management and influenced every aspect of our solution design.</p>
                
                <h3>Initial Engagement and Expectations</h3>
                <p>From our first meeting, it became clear that Friends of Glasgow brought a wealth of practical experience and institutional knowledge that we, as students, could never have anticipated. Their initial briefing revealed the complexity of managing a heritage site like Kibble Palace, balancing preservation requirements with visitor accessibility, managing limited resources while maintaining high standards, and navigating the bureaucratic challenges of public institution management.</p>
                
                <p>What struck us most was their genuine enthusiasm for innovation coupled with a healthy skepticism about technology for technology's sake. They had seen numerous well-intentioned proposals that failed to account for operational realities, and their questions pushed us to think beyond the theoretical into the practical implications of our designs.</p>
                
                <h3>The Evolution of Understanding</h3>
                <p>Through regular feedback sessions and site visits, our understanding of the problem space deepened considerably. The stakeholders' emphasis on inclusivity and accessibility fundamentally changed our approach from a purely digital solution to our hybrid QR/Kiosk system. This wasn't just a design pivot, it was a philosophical shift toward recognizing that good design must serve all users, not just the technologically comfortable.</p>
                
                <p>The heritage preservation constraints initially felt limiting, but our partners helped us reframe these as creative challenges. Their stories about previous unsuccessful technology implementations taught us that the most elegant solution isn't always the most appropriate one. Sometimes the best innovation lies in working within constraints rather than trying to overcome them.</p>
                
                <h3>Communication and Collaboration Dynamics</h3>
                <p>The communication style with Friends of Glasgow was refreshingly direct and constructive. They provided honest feedback about our proposals, pointing out potential operational challenges we hadn't considered. This wasn't discouraging, it was invaluable. Their willingness to share both successes and failures from previous projects gave us insights that no amount of academic research could provide.</p>
                
                <p>We learned to present our ideas not just as technical solutions, but as responses to their specific operational needs. This shift in communication approach improved not only our external presentations but also our internal design discussions. We began evaluating every feature against real-world constraints and user needs rather than theoretical possibilities.</p>
                
                <h3>Impact on Our Design Process</h3>
                <p>The partnership influenced our methodology in profound ways. Their feedback led us to adopt a more iterative approach, testing assumptions early and often rather than developing elaborate solutions in isolation. The stakeholders' concerns about implementation, maintenance, and staff training forced us to consider the entire lifecycle of our solution, not just its initial deployment.</p>
                
                <p>Perhaps most importantly, they helped us understand that successful technology implementation in heritage settings requires more than just technical excellence, it requires cultural sensitivity, operational awareness, and genuine respect for the institution's mission and values.</p>
                
                <h3>Challenges and Learning Moments</h3>
                <p>Not every interaction was smooth. There were moments when our enthusiasm for innovative features clashed with their practical concerns about budget and maintenance. These tensions, however, proved educational. They taught us to balance ambition with pragmatism and to present solutions that were both innovative and implementable.</p>
                
                <p>The most significant learning moment came when we realized that our initial mobile-only approach, while technically sophisticated, would exclude a significant portion of Kibble Palace's visitor demographic. This feedback was initially disappointing but ultimately led to our strongest design decision, the hybrid approach that serves all users effectively.</p>
                
                <h3>Long-term Value of the Partnership</h3>
                <p>Beyond the immediate project benefits, this partnership provided us with a model for future stakeholder engagement. We learned that the best collaborations happen when both parties bring their expertise to the table, we contributed technical knowledge and fresh perspectives, while they provided operational wisdom and institutional context.</p>
                
                <p>The relationship also reinforced the importance of designing with rather than for users. Friends of Glasgow Botanic Gardens weren't just clients to satisfy; they were partners in creating a solution that would genuinely improve their operations and visitor experience.</p>

                <h2>Prototyping Reflection - Full Journey</h2>
                <span class="close" onclick="closePrototypingModal()">&times;</span>
            </div>
            <div class="modal-body">
                <p class="modal-lead">Our prototyping journey was not just a technical phase, it was a transformative process that reshaped how we approached inclusive design, stakeholder engagement, and meaningful user experiences in public heritage spaces like Kibble Palace. It required us to constantly reassess our assumptions, embrace complexity, and balance user needs with institutional realities.</p>
                
                <h3>From Ideas to Impact: Navigating Trade-offs</h3>
                <p>We began with a structured prioritization matrix to critically evaluate six initial concepts. This wasn't merely an academic exercise; it was an essential tool that forced us to reckon with the tension between ambition and feasibility. For example, while thermal sensors and Wi-Fi tracking offered the allure of automation, they also came with major drawbacks, lack of demographic differentiation, and high infrastructural or maintenance cost.</p>
                
                <p>What made this phase especially revealing was the realisation that "innovation" doesn't always mean high-tech. Often, the simplest ideas, like a QR code check-in, are the most resilient and trustworthy, especially in resource-constrained environments. Through this lens, we reframed our criteria for success: not just how advanced a solution was, but how well it fit within the daily realities of the Kibble Palace's operations.</p>
                
                <h3>The Value of Stakeholder Insight</h3>
                <p>Before locking in any design direction, we looped in Chrissy from Friends of Glasgow Botanic Gardens. Her insights provided critical historical context and grounded our work in operational truth. Hearing that a previous attempt to use cellphone signal tracking had failed, not just due to technical limitations, but because of ongoing issues with accuracy and maintenance, validated our direction toward a user-initiated system.</p>
                
                <p>Her emphasis on simplicity, and maintenance-light solutions steered us away from invisible automation and toward visible, intentional interaction.</p>
                
                <h3>From Paper to Pixels: Storyboarding and Lo-Fi Prototyping</h3>
                <p>Our storyboarding phase revealed far more than just user steps. It exposed overlooked moments, like the common risk of users forgetting to check out, that could skew our data and reduce the solution's operational value. This discovery wasn't incidental; it emerged from mapping the emotional and cognitive state of the visitor throughout their journey.</p>
                
                <p>Tourists might be distracted by the space's beauty, families might be managing children, and older visitors might feel rushed. By visualising these friction points early, we could preemptively design around them. This led to one of our most creative interventions, the integration of an AR guide. More than a "cool feature," it was strategically introduced to capture attention at key transition moments and serve as a light-touch nudge toward completing the checkout process.</p>
                
                <p>It demonstrated how narrative, design, and data collection could work together symbiotically. By rapidly iterating elements like field placements and button labels, we learned that usability often lives in the details. For example, changing "pax" to "person" may seem trivial, but it reflected a broader commitment to clarity and universal understanding.</p>
                
                <h3>Prototypes: Designing for Confidence and Inclusion</h3>
                <p>Paper prototypes gave us the agility to test interface logic early and cheaply, enabling fast feedback cycles without getting distracted by visual polish. They encouraged open critique and collaborative iteration within the team, creating a low-pressure environment where ideas could be challenged and improved quickly. Sketching allowed us to focus on flow, structure, and communication, elements often overshadowed by aesthetics in digital tools.</p>
                
                <p>Transitioning to Figma, we then translated those insights into interactive prototypes that brought clarity and coherence to our concepts. Developing both mobile and kiosk prototype versions wasn't just about redundancy, it reflected a deeper design stance: accessibility and inclusion were non-negotiable.</p>
                
                <p>The kiosk wasn't an afterthought for "edge cases" but a core part of the system, designed intentionally for users without smartphones, families sharing devices, and those less familiar or comfortable with QR technology. In doing so, we affirmed that equitable access must be built into the foundation, not layered on later.</p>
                
                <p>The stakeholder dashboard, while not user-tested due to its administrative focus, was built based on direct input from Chrissy and inspired by how real staff might use the data. While excluded from usability testing and storyboarding for relevance reasons, it underscored our commitment to end-to-end system thinking. A check-in system without a usable backend for analysis would be incomplete.</p>
                
                <h3>Iterative Testing: Refining with Empathy</h3>
                <p>Usability testing with five participants surfaced insights that shaped the final solution in meaningful ways. The process revealed not only what users found confusing or clunky (e.g., long numeric codes, unclear terminology) but what they found delightful and motivating. The AR feature was repeatedly praised, not because of novelty, but because it added value to the experience.</p>
                
                <p>This reinforced the idea that utility and engagement are not mutually exclusive.</p>
                
                <h3>Prototyping as Learning, Not Just Building</h3>
                <p>Through this entire phase, we learned that prototyping is as much about team alignment and reflection as it is about user validation. Every design choice, every wireframe, button label, or checkout prompt, was an opportunity to revisit our goals. Were we being inclusive enough? Was this understandable at a glance? Were we honouring the operational capacity of the Palace?</p>
                
                <p>What started as a technical challenge turned into a values-driven design process. The result is not just a functional product but a system that feels right for the space, the people who run it, and the visitors who enjoy it.</p>

                <p class="modal-lead">Our user research and usability testing formed the backbone of our design decisions, challenging initial assumptions and deepening our understanding of both user behavior and contextual constraints. Rather than simply informing design features, these activities actively reshaped the direction, tone, and priorities of our entire solution.</p>
                
                <h3>Breaking Our Assumptions</h3>
                <p>We initially entered the research phase with cautious assumptions, particularly that older visitors might be hesitant to engage with digital tools due to a perceived lack of digital fluency. However, through five in-person interviews conducted at Kibble Palace with a mix of tourists and locals, we encountered perspectives that challenged this narrative.</p>
                
                <p>A memorable moment came from a middle-aged visitor who confidently recounted using digital features at other public gardens and museums. Rather than viewing them as novel or intimidating, he described such tools as a standard part of the modern visitor experience, something he had come to expect and even appreciate.</p>
                
                <p>These insights shifted our understanding: comfort with digital tools is not inherently tied to age but to relevance, clarity, and ease of use. More importantly, users were not just willing to interact, they were eager to do so when it added value to their visit. This redefined our notion of what engagement could look like. Initially, we viewed digital elements as utilitarian, focused solely on collecting visitor data. Through this research, we began to see them as experiential tools that could drive engagement, boost satisfaction, and by extension, yield more reliable data.</p>
                
                <h3>From Functional to Meaningful</h3>
                <p>The turning point in our design thinking came when we stopped viewing data collection as a background task and began treating it as a front-facing opportunity for engagement. Initially, our focus was on building a simple mechanism to record visitor numbers. But through user research and reflection, we realised that digital interaction could be more than just a tool for data, it could drive participation.</p>
                
                <p>This shift reframed our entire approach. The decision to include an AR guide was no longer just an optional, interactive layer. It became a core design feature, something that offered immediate value to visitors while naturally encouraging them to check in and out. In doing so, we captured accurate, timestamped data and demographic insights not through passive monitoring, but through active, willing engagement. What began as a utility system evolved into an experience that both served operational needs and enriched the visitor journey.</p>
                
                <h3>Testing for Real-World Viability</h3>
                <p>In our usability testing phase, we invited five participants (three tourists and two locals) to interact with our working prototypes using the think-aloud method. This not only revealed UI pain points and usability barriers but also provided deeper context around user intent and behavior.</p>
                
                <p>One tourist participant struggled to recall our 6-digit verification code, suggesting it be shortened for easier memorability. Another found the term "pax" unclear, prompting us to replace it with "person" for greater clarity. While these may seem like small tweaks, they revealed a larger truth: seemingly minor interface choices can introduce unnecessary cognitive load and unintentionally exclude users. These real-time insights reinforced that inclusive design isn’t just about major features, it’s often shaped in the details, where clarity and accessibility meet.</p>
                
                <p>Conversely, the AR guide received unanimous praise across both user groups. What was especially noteworthy was not just that users found it "fun" or "cool," but that they appreciated how it fit naturally into their visit. It didn't interrupt their experience, it enriched it. This showed us that the success of digital features lies not in their complexity, but in how seamlessly they integrate into users' natural behaviors and expectations.</p>
                
                <h3>Balancing Dual Perspectives</h3>
                <p>The usability testing also surfaced contrasts between user groups. Tourists, who were often more comfortable with digital tools, appreciated the QR and AR experiences. Locals, who were more habitual visitors, preferred a quicker, less interactive process. This reaffirmed our hybrid design choice, one method would never satisfy all. Offering multiple entry points was the only way to ensure both adoption and equity across demographics.</p>
                
                <h3>Designing Beyond the Interface</h3>
                <p>This process taught us that usability isn't just about button placement or font size, it's about building trust, clarity, and relevance into every step of the journey. By the end of this phase, we had moved from designing an interface to designing an experience, one that offered clarity to the visitor, insight to the stakeholder, and integrity in the data collected.</p>
                
                <h3>Final Reflection</h3>
                <p>In total, our ten user interactions, five interviews and five usability tests, did more than just validate our design; they reshaped our approach. They taught us to listen actively, test often, and design inclusively. Most importantly, they reminded us that in public, heritage-rich environments like Kibble Palace, the true measure of innovation is not technological novelty, but thoughtful, human-centered design.</p>

                                <p>Moving from lo-fi to hi-fi prototypes deepened our understanding of user interaction. Paper sketches helped us quickly explore structure, but only digital prototypes exposed real usability nuances, like visual hierarchy, interaction timing, and accessibility. It also gave stakeholders greater clarity and confidence, helping align expectations across the team. Most importantly, the process reminded us that good design isn't static, it evolves. What looked perfect on paper required adjustments when translated to interactive form.</p>

                                <p>User testing was a pivotal turning point that exposed the gap between assumed and actual user behavior. Where we thought users would breeze through interfaces, we instead saw pauses, repeated actions, or tentative inputs. These micro-behaviors reflected uncertainty, underscoring that even minor interface decisions carry significant cognitive weight. The most profound takeaway was that inclusive design goes beyond accessibility. It requires anticipating not just what users can do, but what they feel comfortable doing.</p>

                                <p>The final stretch was driven by user feedback. Refining our design based on usability testing gave us confidence that our solution addressed real user needs, not just assumptions. As we shifted into final deliverable preparation, we faced the challenge of turning days of iterative exploration into a clear, compelling narrative. This wasn't just about organizing visuals, it required team alignment on the "why" behind each decision. It was an opportunity to reconnect with our original goals and validate that our solution truly addressed the problem we set out to solve.</p>
