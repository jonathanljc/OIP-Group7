                <p class="modal-lead">Our partnership with Friends of Glasgow proved to be one of the most valuable and transformative aspects of this project. What began as a standard stakeholder relationship evolved into a genuine collaboration that fundamentally shaped our understanding of heritage site management and influenced every aspect of our solution design.</p>
                
                <h3>Initial Engagement and Expectations</h3>
                <p>From our first meeting, it became clear that Friends of Glasgow brought a wealth of practical experience and institutional knowledge that we, as students, could never have anticipated. Their initial briefing revealed the complexity of managing a heritage site like Kibble Palace, balancing preservation requirements with visitor accessibility, managing limited resources while maintaining high standards, and navigating the bureaucratic challenges of public institution management.</p>
                
                <p>What struck us most was their genuine enthusiasm for innovation coupled with a healthy skepticism about technology for technology's sake. They had seen numerous well-intentioned proposals that failed to account for operational realities, and their questions pushed us to think beyond the theoretical into the practical implications of our designs.</p>
                
                <h3>The Evolution of Understanding</h3>
                <p>Through regular feedback sessions and site visits, our understanding of the problem space deepened considerably. The stakeholders' emphasis on inclusivity and accessibility fundamentally changed our approach from a purely digital solution to our hybrid QR/Kiosk system. This wasn't just a design pivot, it was a philosophical shift toward recognizing that good design must serve all users, not just the technologically comfortable.</p>
                
                <p>The heritage preservation constraints initially felt limiting, but our partners helped us reframe these as creative challenges. Their stories about previous unsuccessful technology implementations taught us that the most elegant solution isn't always the most appropriate one. Sometimes the best innovation lies in working within constraints rather than trying to overcome them.</p>
                
                <h3>Communication and Collaboration Dynamics</h3>
                <p>The communication style with Friends of Glasgow was refreshingly direct and constructive. They provided honest feedback about our proposals, pointing out potential operational challenges we hadn't considered. This wasn't discouraging, it was invaluable. Their willingness to share both successes and failures from previous projects gave us insights that no amount of academic research could provide.</p>
                
                <p>We learned to present our ideas not just as technical solutions, but as responses to their specific operational needs. This shift in communication approach improved not only our external presentations but also our internal design discussions. We began evaluating every feature against real-world constraints and user needs rather than theoretical possibilities.</p>
                
                <h3>Impact on Our Design Process</h3>
                <p>The partnership influenced our methodology in profound ways. Their feedback led us to adopt a more iterative approach, testing assumptions early and often rather than developing elaborate solutions in isolation. The stakeholders' questions about implementation, maintenance, and staff training forced us to consider the entire lifecycle of our solution, not just its initial deployment.</p>
                
                <p>Perhaps most importantly, they helped us understand that successful technology implementation in heritage settings requires more than just technical excellence, it requires cultural sensitivity, operational awareness, and genuine respect for the institution's mission and values.</p>
                
                <h3>Challenges and Learning Moments</h3>
                <p>Not every interaction was smooth. There were moments when our enthusiasm for innovative features clashed with their practical concerns about budget and maintenance. These tensions, however, proved educational. They taught us to balance ambition with pragmatism and to present solutions that were both innovative and implementable.</p>
                
                <p>The most significant learning moment came when we realized that our initial mobile-only approach, while technically sophisticated, would exclude a significant portion of Kibble Palace's visitor demographic. This feedback was initially disappointing but ultimately led to our strongest design decision, the hybrid approach that serves all users effectively.</p>
                
                <h3>Long-term Value of the Partnership</h3>
                <p>Beyond the immediate project benefits, this partnership provided us with a model for future stakeholder engagement. We learned that the best collaborations happen when both parties bring their expertise to the table, we contributed technical knowledge and fresh perspectives, while they provided operational wisdom and institutional context.</p>
                
                <p>The relationship also reinforced the importance of designing with rather than for users. Friends of Glasgow weren't just clients to satisfy; they were partners in creating a solution that would genuinely improve their operations and visitor experience.</p>

                <p class="modal-lead">Reflecting on our work for the Kibble Palace visitor tracking project, we find myself experiencing a complex mix of pride and humility. While we achieved our core objectives and created a solution that addresses real stakeholder needs, the process also revealed areas where our approach could have been more sophisticated and our execution more thorough.</p>
                
                <h3>What We Are Proud Of</h3>
                
                <h4>Inclusive Design Philosophy</h4>
                <p>We are particularly proud of our commitment to inclusive design from the project's inception. The decision to develop a hybrid QR/Kiosk system wasn't just a technical choice, it was a philosophical statement about who deserves access to digital services. Too often, technology projects assume universal comfort with smartphones and digital interfaces. Our solution acknowledges that meaningful innovation must serve diverse user groups with varying technological capabilities.</p>
                
                <p>This inclusive approach extended beyond just providing multiple interaction methods. We considered cognitive load, physical accessibility, and varying levels of digital literacy in our interface designs. The large, clear buttons on our kiosk interface and the simple, intuitive QR code process reflect our understanding that good design should feel effortless for all users.</p>
                
                <h4>Stakeholder-Centered Process</h4>
                <p>Our approach to stakeholder engagement represents another significant strength. Rather than treating Friends of Glasgow as passive recipients of our solution, we positioned them as active collaborators in the design process. This wasn't just good practice, it was essential for creating a solution that would actually work in their operational context.</p>
                
                <p>The iterative feedback loops we established ensured that our solution evolved in response to real needs rather than theoretical assumptions. Every major design decision was validated against operational requirements and user feedback, resulting in a more grounded and practical final product.</p>
                
                <h4>Heritage Sensitivity</h4>
                <p>Successfully balancing modern technology with respect for Kibble Palace's historical significance required careful consideration and creative problem-solving. I'm proud that we found ways to implement visitor tracking without compromising the site's aesthetic integrity or requiring structural modifications that could damage the heritage fabric.</p>
                
                <p>Our non-invasive approach, using portable kiosks and discrete QR code placements, demonstrates that innovation doesn't require disruption. Sometimes the most sophisticated solution is the one that integrates seamlessly with existing conditions.</p>
                
                <h4>Team Collaboration and Communication</h4>
                <p>Despite our diverse backgrounds and varying levels of experience with different aspects of the project, we maintained excellent communication and shared ownership throughout the process. Our daily briefs and regular check-ins ensured that everyone remained aligned on objectives and progress, while our collaborative decision-making process meant that the final solution truly represents our collective expertise.</p>
                
                <h3>What We Are Not Proud Of</h3>
                
                <h4>Limited User Testing Scale</h4>
                <p>Our user testing, while valuable, was limited in scope and scale. Testing primarily with fellow students and a small number of external participants provided useful feedback, but it couldn't fully validate our assumptions about how actual Kibble Palace visitors would interact with the system.</p>
                
                <p>A more comprehensive testing approach would have included longer-term usability studies, and testing with a broader demographic range. The constraints of our project timeline made this challenging, but we recognize that more extensive testing would have strengthened our solution significantly.</p>
                
                <h4>Implementation and Change Management Planning</h4>
                <p>Perhaps our most significant oversight was the limited attention we paid to implementation planning and change management. While we created a functional solution, we didn't adequately address how it would be deployed, how staff would be trained, or how the transition from current practices would be managed.</p>
                
                <p>Real-world technology implementation requires careful planning for staff training, system integration, maintenance procedures, and contingency planning. Our focus on the solution itself meant that these crucial implementation considerations received insufficient attention.</p>
                
                <h3>Lessons Learned and Future Applications</h3>
                <p>This project taught us that successful design isn't just about creating elegant solutions, it's about understanding constraints, respecting context, and prioritizing user needs over technological sophistication. The most innovative solution isn't always the most appropriate one.</p>
                
                <p>We learned the value of iterative design and remaining flexible as new information emerges. Our willingness to pivot from a mobile-only solution to a hybrid approach resulted in a much stronger final product. This experience reinforced that good design requires both creative vision and practical wisdom.</p>
                
                <p>Perhaps most importantly, we discovered that the best solutions often emerge from the intersection of user needs, technical feasibility, and contextual constraints, not from pushing the boundaries of any single dimension. This holistic approach to problem-solving will inform our future work and help us create solutions that are both innovative and implementable.</p>
                
                <p>While there are aspects of our work that could have been stronger, we believe we created a solution that genuinely addresses stakeholder needs while respecting the unique constraints of heritage site management. The project provided valuable learning experiences that will inform our future practice and demonstrated our ability to collaborate effectively on complex, real-world challenges.</p>
